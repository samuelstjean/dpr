# Diffusion profile realignment (dpr)

An example and assorted implementation from the manuscript **Reducing variability in along-tract analysis with diffusion profile realignment**.
Have a look at the [example](example.ipynb) on how to use the package and run it on a small example dataset.

Coming 'soon' : An easy to use command line version with nice plotting capabilities. I just need to finish tidying it up a bit first.

The data is also available at https://zenodo.org/record/2483169.
