% Example on how to call the main realigment function
% We assume the files have been previously resampled in EDTI so that each subject is represented by one streamline
% per bundle and that the distance between each point (roughly the stepsize) is the same.

% All datasets are in the same folder for simplicity, but this can likely be adapted with a bit of work
