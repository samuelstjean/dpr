# Diffusion profile realignment (dpr)

This is the matlab / [octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) version of the code as now available in [ExploreDTI](http://www.exploredti.com/).

See the example on how to run it as a standalone version.
In this case, we start from individual .mat files per subject.
The original algorithm works with a text file (one subject per line, each column is a different point), which are created from these mat files using ExploreDTI.
